## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Node.js + Express.js |
| Database | MongoDB + Mongoose |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Auth | JWT + Bcrypt |
| HTTP | Axios |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- MongoDB running locally or MongoDB Atlas connection string

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create admin user (uses .env config)
npm run seed:admin

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Backend runs at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

> **Note:** The frontend uses `HashRouter` for client-side routing. This means page URLs will be prefixed with a `#` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/#/dashboard`).

### 3. Login

- **Email**: admin@bharat.com
- **Password**: admin123

> ⚠️ Change these credentials immediately in production!

## User Roles

The system implements role-based access control with two distinct user types:

### Admin
Full system access including:
- Employee account creation and management
- Firm settings and configuration
- Sales analytics and reporting dashboards
- Credit aging and financial insights
- All employee-level permissions

### Employee
Restricted access to core operational functions:
- ✅ Add and edit products
- ✅ Manage inventory quantities
- ✅ Create and view invoices
- ✅ Record customer payments
- ✅ Manage customer profiles
- ❌ Cannot manage other employees
- ❌ Cannot modify firm settings
- ❌ Cannot access admin analytics

> **Accountability**: All actions are attributed to the logged-in user, enabling complete audit trails for invoices, payments, and inventory changes.

## Key Workflows

### Creating an Invoice
1. Select customer (auto-fills address, GSTIN)
2. Search and add products specifying quantity
3. View real-time GST calculations
4. Validate overall stock availability
5. Save invoice → Stock automatically deducted from `Product.currentStockQty`

### Processing a Sales Return
1. Open original invoice and click "Create Return"
2. Select items to return and specify return quantities
3. System validates against originally sold quantities
4. Generate Credit Note → Stock automatically restored to `Product.currentStockQty`
5. Customer credit balance is updated for future adjustments

### GST Calculation
- Base Amount = Quantity × Rate
- Discount Amount = Base Amount × (Discount% / 100)
- Taxable Amount = Base Amount - Discount
- GST = Taxable Amount × (GST% / 100)
- CGST = GST / 2, SGST = GST / 2

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Credit Limits Are Advisory, Not Enforced
In Indian SMB contexts, strict credit limit enforcement often disrupts business relationships. Distributors frequently extend informal credit based on trust and long-standing relationships. The system displays credit warnings but allows admins to override limits, reflecting real-world business practices.

### Invoice Snapshots for Historical Integrity
Invoices capture product details, prices, and customer information at creation time rather than referencing live data. This ensures:
- Invoices remain accurate even if product prices or customer details change later
- Audit-safe records for tax compliance and dispute resolution
- Historical accuracy for financial reporting

### MongoDB Atlas for Database Hosting
Chosen for its managed service benefits:
- Zero-maintenance cloud hosting with automatic backups
- Free tier sufficient for small business workloads
- Seamless scaling path as the business grows
- Built-in monitoring and performance insights

### Free-Tier Hosting Strategy
The application is designed to run on free-tier services (Render for backend, Vercel for frontend, MongoDB Atlas free tier):
- **Trade-off**: Cold starts on Render (backend spins down after inactivity)
- **Mitigation**: Acceptable for small business use cases with predictable usage patterns
- **Benefit**: Zero hosting cost for MVP validation and early production use

## Production Notes

### Deployment Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js application deployable to Render, Railway, Heroku, or any Node.js hosting environment
- **Frontend**: Static build deployable to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or self-hosted MongoDB

### Free-Tier Hosting Constraints
| Service | Limitation | Impact |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Render (Backend) | Sleeps after 15 min inactivity | First request after sleep takes ~30s |
| MongoDB Atlas | 512MB storage limit | Sufficient for ~50,000 invoices |
| Vercel (Frontend) | 100GB bandwidth/month | Adequate for small teams |

### Stability Focus
This system prioritizes **reliability over feature bloat**:
- Battle-tested authentication flow with proper session management
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go invoice creation
- Optimized for real-world usage patterns in small business environments
